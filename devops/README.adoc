=== Building apps
To build the app go to the workspace folder

[source,bash]
----
cd pcf-workshop-workspace/cities
gradle build
----


== PART 1: Build, Push, Bind, Monitor and Scale an App. 

=== Pushing the cities-service app using CLI
[source,bash]
----
cd pcf-workshop-workspace/cities/cities-service
----



Use `cf help` and/or `cf <command> --help` for details on each of the commands below.

. Review the docs: http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/deploy-app.html

. Verify you are logged in with your own userid (*not admin*) and targeted to your PCF instance:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cf target
----

. Push the cities-service:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cf push <first-initial><last-initial>-cities-service -i 1 -m 512M -p build/libs/cities-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----
+
* Be sure to name your application '<first-initial><last-initial>-cities-service'

. Verify you can access your application via a curl request:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ curl -i http://<first-initial><last-initial>-cities-service.cfapps.io
----

The output from this command should look similar to the following:
[source,bash]
----

      "href" : "http://rj-cities-service.cfapps.io/cities{?page,size,sort}",
      "templated" : true
    }
  }
----


=== Enabling Spring Cloud & Profiles

. Review link:http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/buildpacks/java/spring-service-bindings.html[Configuring Service Connections in Spring]

. Note we have the Spring Cloud and MySQL dependencies to our Gradle build:
+
[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
    // ....
    compile("org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-spring-service-connector:1.0.0.RELEASE")
    compile("org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-cloudfoundry-connector:1.0.0.RELEASE")
    runtime("mysql:mysql-connector-java:5.1.25")
}
----

. Note the Spring Cloud Config file +org.example.cities.config.CloudDataSourceConfig+. 
+
[source,java]
----
package org.example.cities.config;

import javax.sql.DataSource;

import org.springframework.cloud.config.java.AbstractCloudConfig;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Profile;

@Profile("cloud")
@Configuration
public class CloudDataSourceConfig extends AbstractCloudConfig {
    @Bean
    public DataSource dataSource() {
        return connectionFactory().dataSource();
    }
}

----

. Note
+
* The `@Profile` annotation will cause this class (which becomes Spring configuration when annotated as `@Configuration`) to be added to the configuration set because of the `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` environment variable (more on this later). You can still run the application locally (with the default profile) using the embedded database.
* With this code, Spring Cloud will detect a bound service that is compatible with +DataSource+, read the credentials, and then create a +DataSource+ as appropriate (it will throw an exception otherwise).

. The properties file at `src/main/resources/application.properties` will cause Hibernate to create the database schema and import data at startup. This is done automatically for embedded databases, not for custom ++DataSource++s. Other Hibernate native properties can be set in a similar fashion:
+
[source,java]
----
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create
----

 
=== Manually Creating a Database Service

Looks like we need a service.  Let's create one.

. Review the docs on Services:
+
* link:http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/adding-a-service.html[Adding a Service]
* link:http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/managing-services.html[Managing Services]
+

. Create a mysql service instance, name it as `<YOUR INITIALS>-cities-db`

. Launch the DB console via the `Manage` link in the Users Console.  Note the database is empty.


=== Manually Binding the Service Instance 

. Review the docs on link:http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/bind-service.html[Binding a Service Instance]

. Bind the mysql instance `<YOUR INITIALS>-cities-db` to your app cities-service

. Restage your cities-service application to inject the new database.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cf restage <first-initial><last-initial>-cities-service
----


=== Binding Services via the Manifest

Next, push the cities-service app.
This time we'll use a manifest to help automate deployment.

. Review the documentation: http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html

. Review the application manifest in your `cities-service` directory called `manifest.yml`.  Minimally, you must set the name of the app, the amount of memory, the number of instances, and the path to the .jar file.
+
*Be sure to name your application '<first-initial><last-initial>-cities-service' and use this as the host value.*
+
We must be able to access your application at https://<first-initial><last-initial>-cities-service.YOUR_PCF_APP_DOMAIN

. The IBM Bluemix team has created a manifest generator app that can also be used:
+
* Hosted: http://cfmanigen.mybluemix.net/
* Source: https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/cf-manifest-generator
+

. Test your manifest by re-pushing your app with no parameters:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cf push
----
. Verify you can access your application via a curl request:
[source,bash]
----
$ curl -i http://<first-initial><last-initial>-cities-service.cfapps.io
----
+
. Add the services binding `<YOUR INITIALS>-cities-db` to your deployment manifest for cities-service .

. Set the `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` environment variable to `cloud` in your deployment manifest.

. Now, manually unbind the service and re-push your app using the manifest.  Was the database populated?

. QUESTION: How would you set the `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` variable from the CLI?


=== Health, logging & events via the CLI

Learning about how your application is performing is critical to help you diagnose and troubleshoot potential issues. Cloud Foundry gives you options for viewing the logs.

To tail the logs of your application perform this command:
[source,bash]
----
$ cf logs <first-initial><last-initial>-cities-service.cfapps.io 
----

Notice that nothing is showing because there isn't any activity. Use the following curl commmand to see the application working:
[source,bash]
----
$ curl -i http://<first-initial><last-initial>-cities-service.cfapps.io/cities/10
----

For other ways of viewing logs check out the documentation here: http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html#view


=== Environment variables

View the environment variable and explantion of VCAP

[source,bash]
----
$ cf env <first-initial><last-initial>-cities-service
----

You will get the output similar to this on your terminal
[source,bash]
----
Getting env variables for app rj-cities-service in org Central / space development as rajesh.jain@pivotal.io...

=== Scaling apps

Applications can be scaled via the command line or the console. When we talk about scale, there are two different types of scale: Vertical and Horizontal.

When you Vertically scale your application, you are increasing the amount of memory made available to your application. Scaling your application horizontally means that you are adding application instances.

Let's vertically scale the application to 1 GB of RAM. 
[source,bash]
----
$ cf scale <first-initial><last-initial>-cities-service -m 1G
----

Now scale your application down to 512 MB.

Next, let's scale up your application to 2 instances
[source,bash]
----
$ cf scale scale <first-initial><last-initial>-cities-service -i 2
----

To check the status of your applications you can check from the command line to see how many instances your app is running and their current state
[source,bash]
----
$ cf app <first-initial><last-initial>-cities-service
----

=== Verify the app from the Console

To verify that the application is running, use the following curl commands to retrieve data from the service:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -i http://<first-initial><last-initial>-cities-service.cfapps.io/cities
----

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -i http://<first-initial><last-initial>-cities-service.cfapps.io/cities/7
----

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -i http://<first-initial><last-initial>-cities-service.cfapps.io/cities?size=5
----

== PART 2: Deploying Upstream App and Bind to backend services

The `cities` directory also includes a `cities-ui` application which uses the `cities-client` to consume from the `cities-service`.

The `cities-client` demonstrates using the link:http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-connectors[Spring Cloud Connector] project to consume from a microservice.  This is a common pattern for 3rd platform apps.  Be sure you understand how it works.

The goal of this exercise is to use what you have learned to deploy the `cities-ui` application.

=== Build the Cities UI and Cities Client App

The cities-ui and cities-client can be both built at once by running `gradle assemble` in the parent +cities+ directory.


=== Create a User Provided Service Instance.
In this section we will create a backend microservice end point for cities-service.

* Review the documentation on link:http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/user-provided.html[User Provided Service Instances]
* Look for the details by running `cf help`.

* You will need to specify two parameters when you create the service instance: `uri` and `tag` (see: CitiesWebServiceInfoCreator.java).
** The `uri` should point to your deployed microservice
** The `tag` is a property specified in the CitiesWebServiceInfoCreator.  Tags have a special meaning in CF:
+
_Tags provide a flexible mechanism to expose a classification, attribute, or base technology of a service, enabling equivalent services to be swapped out without changes to dependent logic in applications, buildpacks, or other services. Eg. mysql, relational, redis, key-value, caching, messaging, amqp.  Tags also allow application configurations to be independent of a service instance name._

+ 
* Refer to the CitiesWebServiceInfoCreator class for the necessary tag value.

[source,bash]
----
cf cups <first-initial><last-initial>-cities-ws -p '{"uri":"http://<first-initial><last-initial>-cities-service.cfapps.io/","tag":"cities"}'
----

=== Deploy cities-ui project 

A `manifest.yml` is included in the cities-ui app.  Edit this manifest with your initials and add the service binding to your cities-service 


[source,bash]
----
---

== PART 3: Deploy Version 2 of the App

=== Delete the unversioned app and the route
[source,bash]
----
cf delete <first-initial><last-initial>-cities-ui
cf delete-route cfapps.io -n <first-initial><last-initial>-cities-ui
----

=== Push Version 2 and Delete the Old Route using the script
We are going to deploy the next version of the `cities-ui` app. The deployment typically is automated using a CD pipeline built with Jenkins or any CD automation tool, but in this workshop we will walk through a simple version number change in the deployment manifest. 

. Edit the `manifest.yml` with the following variables
[source,bash]
---
 VERSION: CITIES_APP_2_0
---

. Edit and source a link:./.env[env file] with the following variables

[source,bash]
---
 export CF_SYSTEM_DOMAIN=
 export CF_APPS_DOMAIN=
 export CF_USER=
 export CF_ORG=
 export CF_SPACE=
 export CF_APP=cities-ui
 export CF_JAR=build/libs/cities-ui.jar
 export CF_MANIFEST=manifest.yml
 export BUILD_NUMBER=2001
---


. Using the bash script `blue-green.sh` in the cities-ui directory, deploy the green v2 and delete the blue v1 of the app.

=== Process of Blue Green Deployment

Review the CF Document for blue green deployment link:http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/blue-green.html[Using Blue-Green Deployment to Reduce Downtime and Risk]

In summary Blue-green deployment is a release technique that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical production environments called Blue and Green.
image:./images/blue-green-process.png[Blue Green Deployment Process]


=== Newsworthy: Automated Blue Green with cf plugin
Cloud Foundry plugin link:https://github.com/concourse/autopilot[Autopilot] does blue green deployment, albeit it takes a different approach to other zero-downtime plugins. It doesn't perform any complex route re-mappings instead it leans on the manifest feature of the Cloud Foundry CLI. The method also has the advantage of treating a manifest as the source of truth and will converge the state of the system towards that. This makes the plugin ideal for continuous delivery environments.
