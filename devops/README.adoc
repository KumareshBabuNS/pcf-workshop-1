= Dev Ops on Cloud Foundry Platform

== Goals

To deploy and configure a microservice and UI, leverage the platform for monitoring & management of the microservice, and automate a continuous delivery pipeline.

== Prerequisites

== Pre-work

. Fork link:https://github.com/rjain-pivotal/pcf-workshop-workspace/[`PCF Workshop Workspace`]  
. Review the link:https://github.com/pcf-alliances-immersion/pcf-immersion-workspace/tree/master/cities[overview] of the `cities` repository.  
. Clone the cities repository locally
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/pivotal-alliances-immersion/pcf-immersion-workspace.git
----

. Review the documentation on link:http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/prepare-to-deploy.html[Considerations for Designing and Running an Application in the Cloud]
. Review the documentation on link:http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html#writing[Writing to logs]

== Steps
In this workshop we are going to follow these steps to deploy apps on Cloud foundry and manage the lifecycle
image:blue-green.png[Blue Green Deployment]

=== Building apps
To build the app go to the workspace folder
[source,perl]
cd pcf-workshop-workspace/cities
gradle build

=== Pushing the cities-service app using CLI
[source,bash]
cd pcf-workshop-workspace/cities/cities-service/build/libs



Use `cf help` and/or `cf <command> --help` for details on each of the commands below.

. Review the docs: http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/deploy-app.html

. Verify you are logged in with your own userid (*not admin*) and targeted to your PCF instance:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cf target
----

. Push the cities-service:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cf push <first-initial><last-initial>-cities-service -i 1 -m 512M -p cities-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----
+
* Be sure to name your application '<first-initial><last-initial>-cities-service'

. Verify you can access your application via a curl request:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ curl -i http://<first-initial><last-initial>cities-service.cfapps.io
----

The output from this command should look similar to the following:
[source,bash]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/hal+json

  "_links" : {
    "cities" : {
      "href" : "http://rr-cities-service.cfapps.io/cities{?page,size,sort}",
      "templated" : true
    }
  }
----

=== Using Manifests to Push the cities-ui app

Next, push the cities-ui app.
This time we'll use a manifest to help automate deployment.

. Review the documentation: http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html

. Create an application manifest in your `cities-service` directory called `manifest.yml`.  Minimally, you must set the name of the app, the amount of memory, the number of instances, and the path to the .jar file.
+
*Be sure to name your application '<first-initial><last-initial>-cities-service' and use this as the host value.*
+
We must be able to access your application at https://<first-initial><last-initial>-cities-service.YOUR_PCF_APP_DOMAIN

. The IBM Bluemix team has created a manifest generator app that can also be used:
+
* Hosted: http://cfmanigen.mybluemix.net/
* Source: https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/cf-manifest-generator
+

. Test your manifest by re-pushing your app with no parameters:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cf push
----
. Verify you can access your application via a curl request:
[source,bash]
----
$ curl -i http://<first-initial><last-initial>cities-service.cfapps.io
----
=== Dependency Injection in Spring

 Bind to in memory database

=== Health, logging & events via the CLI

Learning about how your application is performing is critical to help you diagnose and troubleshoot potential issues. Cloud Foundry gives you options for viewing the logs.

To tail the logs of your application perform this command:
[source,bash]
----
$ cf logs <first-initial><last-initial>-cities-service.cfapps.io
----

Notice that nothing is showing because there isn't any activity. Use the following curl commmand to see the application working:
[source,bash]
----
$ curl -i http://<first-initial><last-initial>-cities-service.cfapps.io/cities/10
----

For other ways of viewing logs check out the documentation here: http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html#view

=== Binding to services

 Bind Cities Services to MySQL
 Bind Cities UI to Cities Services

=== Environment variables

 View the environment variable and explantion of VCAP

=== Scaling apps

Applications can be scaled via the command line or the console. When we talk about scale, there are two different types of scale: Vertical and Horizontal.

When you Vertically scale your application, you are increasing the amount of memory made available to your application. Scaling your application horizontally means that you are adding application instances.

Let's vertically scale the application to 1 GB of RAM. 
[source,bash]
----
$ cf scale <first-initial><last-initial>-cities-service -m 1G
----

Now scale your application down to 512 MB.

Next, let's scale up your application to 2 instances
[source,bash]
----
$ cf scale scale <first-initial><last-initial>-cities-service -i 2
----

To check the status of your applications you can check from the command line to see how many instances your app is running and their current state
[source,bash]
----
$ cf app <first-initial><last-initial>-cities-service
----

=== Verify the app from the Console

=== Create Version 2

 Create Version 2 by changing the Version Number Env variable 

=== Push Version 2 and Delete the Old Route using the script
Create a link:./.env[env file] with the following variables
[source,bash]
CF_SYSTEM_DOMAIN: the CF system domain
CF_APPS_DOMAIN: the CF apps domain
CF_USER: the user account
CF_ORG: org to deploy to
CF_SPACE: space to deply to
CF_APP: the app name
CF_JAR: path to the jar on jenkins
CF_MANIFEST: path to the manifest on jenkins
CF_PWD: your password

Using the bash script link:./blue-green.sh[blue-green.sh] deploy the green v2 and delete the blue v1 of the app. 

[source,bash]
----

cf login -a https://api.$CF_SYSTEM_DOMAIN <Add the correct flags to include the username, password, org and space> --skip-ssl-validation

DEPLOYED_VERSION_CMD=$(CF_COLOR=false cf apps | grep $CF_APP- | cut -d" " -f1)
DEPLOYED_VERSION="$DEPLOYED_VERSION_CMD"
ROUTE_VERSION=$(echo "${BUILD_NUMBER}" | cut -d"." -f1-3 | tr '.' '-')
echo "Deployed Version: $DEPLOYED_VERSION"
echo "Route Version: $ROUTE_VERSION"

# push a new version and map the route
cf <???> "$CF_APP-$BUILD_NUMBER" -n "$CF_APP-$ROUTE_VERSION" -d $CF_APPS_DOMAIN -p $CF_JAR -f $CF_MANIFEST
cf <???> "$CF_APP-${BUILD_NUMBER}" $CF_APPS_DOMAIN -n $CF_APP

if [ ! -z "$DEPLOYED_VERSION" -a "$DEPLOYED_VERSION" != " " -a "$DEPLOYED_VERSION" != "$CF_APP-${BUILD_NUMBER}" ]; then
  echo "Performing zero-downtime cutover to $BUILD_NUMBER"
  echo "$DEPLOYED_VERSION" | while read line
  do
    if [ ! -z "$line" -a "$line" != " " -a "$line" != "$CF_APP-${BUILD_NUMBER}" ]; then
      echo "Scaling down, unmapping and removing $line"
      # Unmap the route and delete
      cf <???>-route "$line" $CF_APPS_DOMAIN -n $CF_APP
      cf <???> "$line" -f
      cf delete-route $CF_APPS_DOMAIN -n "$line" -f
    else
      echo "Skipping $line"
    fi
  done
fi
