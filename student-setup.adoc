= Workshop set up

Depending on the type of the workshop the setup might vary. 
Here are the basic requirements and setup for the DevOps Workshop.

== Required

. Java JDK 1.7+ link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[here]

. Homebrew (Mac)
----
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
----
. Ruby (Mac) 
Mac OSX comes with ruby, you can upgrade the version using 
----
$brew upgrade ruby
----

. Gradle which can be downloaded link:https://gradle.org/downloads/[here].

.. Directions for installing on Mac link:http://ondrej-kvasnovsky.blogspot.com/2012/05/how-to-install-gradle-on-mac-os.html[here].
.. Directions for installing on Windows link:http://rominirani.com/2014/07/28/gradle-tutorial-part-1-installation-setup/[here].
. Git Client
. Cloud Foundry CLI

== Optional
. Bundler
. Bosh CLI
. Spring Source Tool Suite
. Remmina (Remote Desktop Client)
. JMeter

== Basic Commands 
=== Gradle

=== Homebrew
Homebrew is the the missing package manager for OS X link:http://brew.sh/
Some important commands to use brew link:https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/FAQ.md

----
$brew install <package>
$brew update
$brew doctor
$brew outdated
$brew upgrade

----

== Git Client
This workshop requires you to have git client software installed.  If you don't already have git installed, a nice GUI interface is link:http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/[SourceTree], which is available for both Mac OSX and Windows.  Otherwise you can use the following command-line utilities:

=== Mac
Either of the following:

* GitHub graphical Git client, can download link:https://mac.github.com/[here].  Be sure to install the command line tools during the install.
* Git command line, can download link:http://git-scm.com/downloads[here].

=== Windows
 * git for windows, can download link:https://msysgit.github.io/[here].  During the install, select the option for bash shell only.  Then run the Git Bash application from the Start Menu rather than the Git GUI application.  We've found that this approach eliminates a lot of problems for students with windows laptops.

You should be familar with the git command line basics:

* git clone - clone an existing repo
* git add - add new or existing file to index to be committed
* git commit -m "commit message" - record changes to the repo
* git push - push committed changes to the remote repo
* git status - show status of local changes

== PCF Workshop Repository

Clone this repository so that you have access to the workshop content, presentations.
PDF copies are included in the same directory as each Keynote.

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone <this-repo>
----


== Workshop VM

A workshop VM is provided which includes all the tools needed for the workshop.  Use of this VM is optional.  If you are setting up prior to the workshop, you can download it from link:https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pcf-immersion/pcf-immersion-ubuntu-14.04.1-amd64.box[here].

=== VM Details

The VM is Ubuntu 14.04.1.  It contains:

* Cloud Foundry CLI
* Ruby
* Bundler
* Bosh CLI
* Git
* Java
* Gradle
* Spring Source Tool Suite
* Remmina (Remote Desktop Client)
* JMeter

The packer scripts used to build the box are included in this repository in the `packer` directory in case you would like to make changes to the box.

=== Using the box

The workshop VM is distributed as a vagrant box.  Be sure you have Vagrant and the Virtual Box provider installed.

==== Adding the box

The box will be distributed via thumb drive.

. Copy the .box file to your local machine.

. Add the box to vagrant:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ vagrant box add pcf-immersion-box <PATH_TO_THE_BOX_FILE>
----
+


==== Launching the VM

A Vagrantfile is included in the `pcf-immersion-workspace` project.

To launch the box:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd pcf-immersion-workspace
$ vagrant up
----


==== Logging into the box

* The vm will launch with a UI.  However, unless you are using Remote Desktop or STS, you don't need to be logged into the UI.  Instead you can simply ssh.  From your `pcf-immersion-workspace` directory:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ vagrant ssh
----

* If you can't find the installed software on the path, you may need to explicitly load the profile:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ source ~/.bash_profile
----


* To login to the UI, use the default username/password which is vagrant/vagrant.  To open a new terminal window, use the shortcut ctrl+alt+t (control+option+t for mac), then source the bash profile as shown above.

==== Sharing a directory

By default, vagrant will share the project directory containing the Vagrantfile and sync it between your machine and the VM.  In the VM, the share is be default located at `/vagrant`.

*It is HIGHLY recommended that you use this directory for classwork.*

This will prevent you from losing your work in the event you run a `vagrant destroy` or otherwise harm the VM.

Note: You should also be committing and pushing to your fork frequently.

==== Cutting & Pasting

By default, VirtualBox disables cutting and pasting between your host and the VM.  To enable it:

. Be sure the VM is running
. VirtualBox > Settings > General > Advanced > Shared Clipboard (Bidirectional)
. Restart the VM:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ vagrant halt
$ vagrant up
----
+
