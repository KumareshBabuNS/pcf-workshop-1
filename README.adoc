= Pivotal CF Customer Workshop

CF Customer facing workshops are intended for customer sessions. Customer workshops are a sales acceleration tool, once the demo and initial discovery is done, and before the customer commits on a POC, workshops helps the conversation going.
Normal transformation platform sales cycles are long, workshops can be a useful tool to get everyone on the organization on the same page and acquainted to the platform.

This are not *__enablement/training__* modules but rather focused around 3-5 use cases, which typically would be covered in a POC. Executing the workshops at customer locations will help in reducing the duration and scope of POCs.

* Workshops are hands on
* Workshops align to the sales plays
* Make the workshop repeatable, consistent and current content
* Each core FE should be able to deliver it
* Focus on beyond Push, Day 2 , Operationalize PCF

== Material Format Philosophy

* *Presentations* introduce concepts.  They should not provide detail and never reformat the same content available on the docs site as bullets.  Heavily bulleted presentations tend to be boring so we favor animation.  Well rehearsed animation illustrates and explains concepts with very few words (see Onsiâ€™s talk on Diego at link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OkmVTFhfLY[CF Summit]).
+
*Note*: Powerpoint versions of the presentations are included.  These are exported from Keynote and may have formatting issues.
+

* *Docs* are for detail.  Students should get in the habit of reading and referring to the docs site.  Open book "quizzes" in the curriculum help ensure students read the docs.

* *Asciidoc* docs in git define the course, links and work.  They are easy to edit, format and navigate.
